# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue with Empty Data

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native's FlatList component where it doesn't render correctly when the initial data is empty.  The issue arises when fetching data asynchronously and the FlatList attempts to render before the data is available, resulting in an empty or improperly rendered view.

## Bug Description

The provided `bug.js` file showcases the problem.  The `FlatList` is populated using an asynchronous `useEffect` hook.  If the API call fails or returns an empty array, the `FlatList` may not render properly leading to a blank screen or other visual inconsistencies. This is different from a loading state, which usually shows a loading indicator, and is instead a rendering failure caused by unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution by adding a check for empty data within the render method, rendering a suitable message if no data is present. Alternatively one could also add a loading indicator which is more typical in this scenario.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app using a React Native environment (e.g., Expo).
4. Observe the behavior when data is fetched successfully and when it is empty or the API call fails.
